Stash
-----

Stash is a fast and simple personal finance application.

Its core data-storage and serialisation files are written in C++, and
there is an existing (but somewhat old) native Mac OS interface written in
Objective-C++ / Cocoa, as well as a much more recent, and still under-development
Qt interface being written, mainly for Linux support.

Features
--------

* Easy-to-use interface to view and edit transactions
* Localised Dates and Currency formatting
* Multiple Accounts
* Split Transactions
* OFX Import/Export
* QIF Import/Export
* Scheduled Transactions
* Pie Chart Graphs
* Area Chart Graphs over time
* Overview Chart Graphs

Licence
-------

Stash is licensed under the GPL version 2.0. For more information, see the included
Licence.txt file.

Downloading
-----------

Stash is hosted on GitHub. Its project page is here:
http://github.com/ppearson/Stash

If you want to download the source code, you can do the following:

git clone git://github.com/ppearson/Stash

Helping
-------

Any help with Stash is more than welcome. As mentioned above, Stash's core is written in
C++, with the Mac Cocoa interface written in Objective-C++. The list of features still to be
implemented in Stash that I hope to get to eventually is:

* Encryption of data files
* Import Rules
* CSV import/export
* Reports
* Budgets
* Multiple currencies
* Qt port of Stash (Windows, Linux)
